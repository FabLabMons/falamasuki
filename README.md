This is going to be a Spring-Boot backend with a React.JS frontend application.
I will bootstrap the code following [this tutorial][spring-react-tuto].

As a starting point, I will stick to the current way that the [FabLab Mons][fablabmons] is organized.

## Code style guide

I've chosen the [Google Java Style Guide][google-style-guide] because it is consistent and well described.
